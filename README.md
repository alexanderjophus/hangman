## Goals

This is meant as a light weight intro to creating a production ready Go server. This will cover topics such as unit/integration testing, Dockerising a go binary, using vendor, etc.

## Core

These lessons are meant to enable everyone to get onto the same playing field. They go from a hello world application to a simple hangman CLI.

## Extra

These lessons assume we have the core lessons finished and have a working CLI hangman game (or other game if we're adopting this for similar things)

Extra lessons;

- Unit testing
